title: "Machine learning with {tidymodels}"
---

## Welcome  

Summary: This workshop will provide a gentle introduction to machine learning with R using the modern suite of predictive modeling packages called **tidymodels**.
We will build, evaluate, compare, and tune predictive models. Along the way, weâ€™ll learn about key concepts in machine learning including overfitting, the holdout method, the bias-variance trade-off, ensembling, cross-validation, and feature engineering.
Learners will gain knowledge about good predictive modeling practices, as well as hands-on experience using **tidymodels** packages like **parsnip**, **rsample**, **recipes**, **yardstick**, and **tune**.

Pre-requisites: Some introductory experience with R.

## Installation 

Please join the workshop with a computer that has the following installed (all available for free):

A recent version of R, available at https://cran.r-project.org/
A recent version of RStudio Desktop (RStudio Desktop Open Source License, at least v2022.02), available at https://www.rstudio.com/download
The following R packages, which you can install from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("embed", "forcats","remotes", 
                   "tidymodels", "glmnet"))

remotes::install_github("emilhvitfeldt/elevators")
```
